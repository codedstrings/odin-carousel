## Project Overview
This is a learning project done as part of the odin project. The goal of the project is to learn how to create carousels using javascript. I extended this project to learn how to use Asynchronous API calls to randomly fetch cat gifs from giphy. 
## Usage
just refresh the page to fetch new cat gifs. Note: there's a limit of 100 gifs per hour as I'm using the free tier of Giphy API
